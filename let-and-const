Quiz

  1. Var is function scoped, and can be reassigned and redeclared. Let is block scoped and can only be reassigned, not redeclared.
  Var is also hoisted whereas let is not.
  2. Const cannot be reassigned or redeclared, and like let, it is block scoped. Also like let, const is not hoisted, though var is.
  3. Let can be reassigned, but const cannot be.
  4. Hoisting happens when a varâ€™s declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope. The value is undefined until the location of its 
  first written appearance in the code, where the initialization occurs. This also happens with functions, where you can invoke them
  before their definitions in the code base.
